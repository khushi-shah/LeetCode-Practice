List.c
	The main library file which creates the List ADT. Includes the NodeObj, ListObj, and 
	Node structs. Implements all the functions of the List ADT as described in List.h 
	using these structs.

List.h
	Header file containing the export pointer type as well as the the hearder declaration
	for all functions in the List ADT as implemented in the List.c library. Also includes
	all information regarding the pre and post contidions of the functions and the purpose
	of the function.

Graph.c
	The main library file which implements the functions from Graph.h which create/destroy
	a graph and it's transpose, as well as return information about the graph and also add
	edges/arcs and perform DFS operations on the Graph.

Graph.h
	Header file containing the final export type for Graoh ADT as well as all the access
	function and manipulation procedures for the ADT.

GraphTest.c
	Includes detailed tests for the Graph ADT as inplemented in Graph.c. It tests for all
	corner cases. Some are tested fully computationally and some manually through the
	terminal.

FindPath.c
	Reads the number of verticies and arcs from the infile and creates a graph from the
	information. Then proceeds to print the graph in the outfile along with it's strongly
	connected components.

Makefile
	Contains all the command line commands to compile and run List.c, Graph.c, 
	GraphTest.c, and FindComponents.c

README
	Contians a detailed table of contents and descriptions of each file in the project folder.
